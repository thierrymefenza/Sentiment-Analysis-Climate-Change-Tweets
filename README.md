# Sentiment-Analysis-Climate-Change-Tweets

In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing peopleâ€™s sentiments on climate change based on their tweets. This dataset can be found in: https://www.kaggle.com/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset

Our project will be organized as follows:
  - Notebook 1: We will do some preprocessing on the dataset (cleaning, encoding, tokenization, etc ) and explore the dataset. Then we will construct models (Random Forest, Neural Network, KNN, LSTM, etc) based on Word2vec or BERT. We will end up evaluating it qualitatively and quantitatively using the F1 score and computed on the test set of our dataset and Roc curve
  - Notebook 2: present our aspect based sentiment analysis
